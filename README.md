## Overview

Work Day Scheduler is a modern, responsive daily planning application designed to help users organize tasks efficiently throughout the workday. The project was fully refactored to remove legacy dependencies and rebuilt using modern JavaScript and CSS practices.

Each day maintains its own schedule using local storage, ensuring tasks persist without carrying over to future dates.
